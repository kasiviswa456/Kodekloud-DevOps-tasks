We deployed a Nginx and PHPFPM based application on Kubernetes cluster last week and it had been working fine. This morning one of the team members was troubleshooting an issue with this stack and he was supposed to run Nginx welcome page for now on this stack till issue with phpfpm is fixed but he made a change somewhere which caused some issue and the application stopped working. Please look into the issue and fix the same:



The deployment name is nginx-phpfpm-dp and service name is nginx-service. Figure out the issues and fix them. FYI Nginx is configured to use default http port, node port is 30008 and copy index.php under /tmp/index.php to deployment under /var/www/html. Please do not try to delete/modify any other existing components like deployment name, service name etc.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.



Solution:




kubectl cp /tmp/index.php nginx-phpfpm-dp-5cccd45499-8bvcm:/var/www/html -c nginx-container


kubectl exec -it nginx-phpfpm-dp-5cccd45499-8bvcm -c nginx-container -- bash

kubectl edit configmap. 


We need to add index.php in the configmap

Kubectl edit  svc (ADD the port in service file)



Note: make sure you edit the configmap and add index.php and recreate the pod. try again all the best{ after this please run cp commad again}
