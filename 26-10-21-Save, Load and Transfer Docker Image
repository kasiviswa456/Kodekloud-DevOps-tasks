One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name ecommerce:xfusion. Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.



a. On App Server 1 save the image ecommerce:xfusion in an archive.

b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.

c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.

Note: Docker is already installed on both servers; however, if its service is down please make sure to start it.



Solution:

App Server1:

    docker images
    docker save -o /tmp/ecommerce.tar ecommerce:xfusion
    cd /tmp/
    ls
    scp ecommerce.tar banner@172.16.238.12:/tmp
    
    
    App server2:
    
    
    1  clear
    2  cd /tmp/
    3  ls
    4  systemctl status docker
    5  systemctl start docker
    6  systemctl status docker
    7  clear
    8  docker load -i ecommerce.tar 
    9  docker images
    
    
 -- Completed---
