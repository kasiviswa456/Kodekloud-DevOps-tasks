The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization, which issupposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments soon. In today's stand-up meeting one of the team members has been assigned a task to create and test a docker container with certain requirements. Below are more details:



a. On App Server 1 in Stratos DC pull nginx image (preferably latest tag but others should work too).

b. Create a new container with name apps from the image you just pulled.

c. Map the host volume /opt/finance with container volume /home. There is an sample.txt file present on same server under /tmp; copy that file to /opt/finance. Also please keep the container in running stat



Solution:


First, SSH to the required host indicated in the question
Pull the image specified in the question as below: sudo docker pull ubuntu:latest (In this example, ubuntu:latest was the image mentioned in the question)
Run a docker container with the name specified in the question using the image you just pulled. Since, you need to keep the container running, you need to use the option -it. Also make sure you are mapping the correct local directory to the directory path in the container (In this example, /opt/sysops is mapped to /usr/src on the container): sudo docker run --name apps -v /opt/sysops:/usr/src -d -it ubuntu:latest
Make sure container is running: sudo docker ps
Finally, copy the file mentioned in the question to the local directory you mapped to the container: cp /tmp/sample.txt /opt/sysops/

sudo docker exec -it apps /bin/bash

--Completed---
