New packages need to be installed on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. The Nautilus DevOps team has decided to install the same using Puppet. Since jump host is already configured to run as Puppet master server and all app servers are already configured to work as puppet agent nodes, we need to create required manifests on the Puppet master server so that it can be applied on all Puppet agent nodes. Please find more details about the task below.

Create a Puppet programming file news.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on master node i.e Jump Server and using puppet package resource perform the tasks below.

Install package tomcat through Puppet package resource and start its service through puppet service resource on all Puppet agent nodes i.e all App Servers.
Note: Please perform this task using news.pp only, do not create any separate inventory file.


Solution:


class tomcat {
   Package { "tomcat":
      ensure => "installed"
   }
   service {"tomcat":
      ensure => "running"
   }
}

node default {}
node "stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com", "stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com", "stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com" {
include tomcat
}

Create this file on news.pp file in /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory



Run this command in all the app server --   puppet agent -tv

next run below command on Jump server:

puppet apply news.pp
